            const annotations = {
                "v1-1": "This opening line, spoken by Ganga to Anshul, directly asks 'Anshul, what happened?' or 'What's wrong, Anshul?'. It immediately sets a tone of direct confrontation or concern.",
                "v1-2": "The following line suggests Anshul was initially 'sleeping' or unaware of the situation, only to be awakened by a 'thunderclap,' which could symbolize the arrival of Ganga's unexpected text after three months. This hints at Anshul's emotional or relational dormancy being abruptly disturbed.",
                "v1-3": "Ganga tells Anshul he felt he 'gained less and sowed more' in their relationship, indicating his perception of unequal effort or emotional return.",
                "v1-4": "The subsequent line, 'he hid the awakened hopes,' refers to Anshul's internal struggle: Ganga's text after three months ignites new hopes for their relationship, but due to past disappointments and a belief that things won't work out, he suppresses these burgeoning feelings.",
                "v1-5": "Ganga observes that Anshul is ignoring her text, instead consumed by his memories of their past.",
                "v1-6": "She then reveals that this is her 'first text' to him after 'three months' of silence. This highlights Anshul's internal conflict and emotional preoccupation, as Ganga's sudden reappearance forces him to confront their shared history rather than immediately respond to her present communication.",
                "v1-7": "Ganga observes Anshul dismissing her text notification within a few seconds, choosing not to open it.",
                "v1-8": "She acknowledges his annoyance but admits she didn't fully anticipate this specific reaction, highlighting his avoidance and her slight surprise.",
                "v1-9": "Ganga expresses her perplexity, feeling as though the ground has been pulled from under her feet, a direct result of Anshul's dismissal of her text.",
                "v1-10": "She reflects that their paths had 'separated many times before,' highlighting a recurring pattern of breakups or estrangement, yet this instance still deeply affects her.",
                "v1-11": "Ganga reflects that both she and Anshul have been the 'reason' for issues in their past. However,",
                "v1-12": "this time, genuine 'forgiveness did not emerge from his heart,' indicating Anshul's deep-seated unwillingness to truly forgive her.",
                "v1-13": "Ganga states that the wound has 'festered,' implying an old, unresolved issue has worsened over time.",
                "v1-14": "She specifies that this deep-seated problem dates back to 'three years ago,' emphasizing the long-standing nature of their core grievances.",
                "v1-15": "Ganga recounts the first time she accepted love or her feelings for Anshul.",
                "v1-16": "However, the very next day, she changed her mind and told him what she had said was a lie. This highlights a pivotal moment where Ganga herself retracted her emotional commitment, creating a deep-seated wound for Anshul.",
                "v1-17": "Ganga recounts Anshul's furious reaction to her changing her mind, stating that he called her a 'BITCH' and 'crossed many limits' with his words. From Ganga's perspective, this verbal assault represents her actual wound in their shared history.",
                "v1-18": "She notes that despite Anshul being 'drowned in shame,' he 'still didn't stop,' highlighting the relentless and unyielding nature of his anger and hurt following her previous betrayal.",
                "v1-19": "Ganga refers to Anshul's tendency to express his frustration through words whenever things 'didn't go his way.'",
                "v1-20": "She contrasts their past, where he 'seemed perfect yesterday,' with his current state, observing 'how repulsive he is today,' highlighting a significant negative shift in his perceived demeanor due to his persistent anger.",
                "v1-21": "Ganga critically questions Anshul's behavior, highlighting his perceived traits of being 'desperate and clingy' and wondering why he is 'so impulsive'.",
                "v1-22": "Ganga expresses profound embarrassment by Anshul's actions. She states she 'hides him from everyone, in shame,' using the metaphor of a 'face behind a veil' to illustrate the depth of her desire to conceal their association due to his behavior.",
                "v1-23": "She states she 'hides him from everyone, in shame,' using the metaphor of a 'face behind a veil' to illustrate the depth of her desire to conceal their association due to his behavior.",
                "v1-24": "Ganga reveals a conditional recall of Anshul: his memory only surfaces when she is 'alone' and 'seeking companionship'.",
                "v1-25": "She then dismissively questions Anshul's pursuit of love within their dynamic, asking 'what kind of relationship is this?' This highlights her detachment and skepticism about the nature of their connection.",
                "v1-26": "This serves as a meta-reveal: Ganga observes that Anshul is 'writing songs, weaving her perspective,' indicating he is imagining her words.",
                "v1-27": "She immediately dismisses his understanding, stating, 'you think you know what I think,' and that he is 'truly beyond saving' in his misinterpretation of her feelings.",
                "v1-28": "Ganga asserts, 'I don't think about you at all whether it is day or night.'",
                "v1-29": "At the same time, she claims, 'I rule over your head irrespective of what time it is,' signifying her profound indifference to Anshul while simultaneously acknowledging her undeniable and continuous presence in his thoughts.",
                "v1-30": "This line, 'Anshul ki hoya?' (Anshul, what happened?), marks a recurring question posed by Ganga. It serves to address Anshul directly, establishing the conversational tone of the verse.",
                "intermission-1": "This 'thunder' refers to Neesh's voicemail revealing Ganga is dating again, which occurred just before this verse. This revelation acts as a profound shock, waking Anshul from a metaphorical dormancy or denial about their relationship.",
                "intermission-2": "This 'thunder' refers to Neesh's voicemail revealing Ganga is dating again, which occurred just before this verse. This revelation acts as a profound shock, waking Anshul from a metaphorical dormancy or denial about their relationship.",
                "v2-1": "This line translates to 'Anshul, what happened?' It is a direct repetition of the opening line of both Verse 1 and Verse 2.",
                "v2-2": "Ganga observes that Anshul 'woke up' as if by 'thunder' from a 'sleep'. This 'thunder' refers to Neesh's voicemail revealing Ganga is dating again, which occurred just before this verse. This revelation acts as a profound shock, waking Anshul from a metaphorical dormancy or denial about their relationship.",
                "v2-3": "Here, Ganga (as imagined by Anshul, whose perspective is now deeply influenced by Neesh's revelation of her new relationship) states that she felt she 'gained less and sowed more' in their relationship.",
                "v2-4": "This is a direct inversion of a similar line in Verse 1 where Anshul felt he was the one who gained less. This flip reveals the conflicting, self-centered perceptions of their past relationship, where both believed they contributed more and received less, thereby deepening Anshul's emotional turmoil now that she has clearly moved on.",
                "v2-5": "Ganga (still in Anshul's imagined perspective, post-Neesh's revelation) explicitly states that her 'eyes met with strangers,' and they 'captivated her heart.' This directly confirms her new relationship, emphasizing that her affections have shifted to someone new and external to Anshul, further cementing his sense of replacement.",
                "v2-6": "Ganga (in Anshul's imagined internal monologue, following Neesh's revelation) explicitly states that her new partner 'is everything that Anshul is not.' This direct comparison and dismissal are deeply painful for Anshul, confirming his fears of being replaced and devalued, especially after her heart was 'captivated by strangers.'",
                "v2-7": "Ganga describes how she would make promises to meet Anshul, but then afterwards claim she was 'not in the mood.' This highlights a pattern of inconsistent behavior and emotional manipulation from her, contributing to Anshul's frustration and hurt, particularly in light of her new relationship.",
                "v2-8": "Ganga states that 'without seeing him now, her mind finds no peace.' This powerfully conveys her deep emotional investment and new attachment to her current partner, starkly contrasting with her previous inconsistent behavior towards Anshul. For Anshul, hearing this (or imagining her saying this) would solidify the painful reality of her moving on and finding happiness elsewhere.",
                "v2-9": "Ganga declares that Anshul 'was a bad habit,' but then, referencing her new partner, states that 'apart from him today, no soul of hers remains.' This powerfully signifies her complete emotional detachment from Anshul and her total absorption into her new relationship, further underscoring how she has moved on and found a new center for her being.",
                "v2-10": "Ganga states that she 'put off all of Anshul's dreams' in which she 'was a part.' This implies a direct action on her part, signifying her deliberate choice to set aside or make his aspirations for their shared future futile, further emphasizing her emotional distance and the finality of their separation.",
                "v2-11": "Ganga states that 'her story revolves around him (her new partner),' and Anshul 'is just a mere chapter.' This clearly defines Anshul's diminished role in her life, signifying her complete focus on her new relationship and her categorical dismissal of their past as insignificant.",
                "v2-12": "Ganga states that Anshul 'was good to pass time with, whatever time she could give him.' This clearly positions Anshul as a temporary distraction or a way for her to fill time, highlighting a transactional and superficial aspect of their past relationship from her perspective. It stands in stark contrast to her current deep emotional investment in her new partner.",
                "v2-13": "Ganga emphasizes that 'all her time is his (her new partner's), and she has taken nothing for herself.' This powerfully conveys her complete self-sacrifice and devotion to her new relationship, highlighting the depth of her current commitment. This stands in stark contrast to her previous, more transactional approach with Anshul, where she offered limited time.",
                "v2-14": "Ganga states that her new partner 'becomes the topic of discussion when she sits with her friends.' This highlights her pride and open celebration of her new relationship, publicly acknowledging him. This contrasts sharply with her earlier embarrassment and hiding Anshul from everyone in Verse 1.",
                "v2-15": "Ganga states that her new partner 'settles into her habits, staying in her thoughts.' This signifies a deep integration of her new partner into her daily life and mental landscape, reflecting a profound level of comfort and constant presence. This further emphasizes her strong emotional connection and contrasts with her past relationship dynamics with Anshul.",
                "v2-16": "Ganga questions, 'acting like him, is this what they call love?' This reveals her deep immersion into her new partner's way of being, suggesting she's adopting his behaviors. Her question implies a reflective or perhaps even a slightly surprised realization about the depth and nature of her new attachment, contrasting with her past, less integrated relationships.",
                "v2-17": "Ganga states that her new partner 'fills her life with deep colors and makes it fragrant with enthusiasm.' This vividly describes the profound positive impact her new relationship has on her, suggesting it brings richness, vibrancy, and joy that was absent before. This further highlights the stark contrast with her past relationship with Anshul, implying a newfound fulfillment.",
                "v2-18": "Ganga imagines Anshul 'in the silence of the night, holding his forehead in thought', contemplating...",
                "v2-19": "'how much her new partner caresses her wheatish-complexioned body'. This contrasts Anshul's isolation and longing with Ganga's current intimacy and emotional detachment, highlighting her awareness of his pain.",
                "v2-20": "Ganga imagines Anshul 'when he tries to suppress these thoughts,' he 'throws away what he has written and hides it.' This suggests that Anshul is attempting to cope with his pain and longing by expressing it through writing, but ultimately finds the expression too overwhelming or shameful, leading him to destroy and conceal his thoughts. This action further highlights his internal struggle and the private nature of his grief.",
                "v2-21": "Ganga continues her imagined scenario of Anshul, stating that 'he pushes the pages into the water, but eventually they float to the surface.' This metaphor suggests that despite his efforts to suppress and destroy his painful thoughts and expressions, they inevitably resurface, indicating the persistent and inescapable nature of his grief and longing for her. This reinforces his internal struggle, as mentioned in the previous line.",
                "v2-22": "Ganga notes that Anshul 'left Patiala a few months ago'.",
                "v2-23": "Fearing this separation, she 'poured immense love' on him.",
                "v2-24": "She clarifies this was 'the second time' she had done so, with the first instance being when she initially accepted her own feelings for him in Verse 1 ('pehli vaari mai pyaar jdon kareya kabool'). However, 'her mind grew weary again soon,' and Anshul 'could see the fallout' as their companionship ended.",
                "v2-25": "This highlights the relationship's fragility, built on fear rather than genuine connection, leading to its demise.",
                "v2-26": "This line offers a profound meta-insight into the song's structure: Anshul is imagining Ganga articulating his own act of imagining her perspective, a narrative technique consistent with Verse 1 where he explicitly frames the song as being written from her viewpoint. He envisions Ganga stating that he (Anshul) is 'seeking regret by weaving her perspective.' This demonstrates Anshul's deep introspection and self-awareness, as he pictures Ganga recognizing his efforts to understand her viewpoint, potentially to find reasons for their breakup or to fuel his self-blame.",
                "v2-27": "This reinforces the song's meta-narrative where Anshul constructs the entire song from Ganga's imagined perspective, as established in Verse 1: 'te hun tun likhda geet, bunnke nazariya mera' (and now you write a song, weaving my perspective). The repetition emphasizes Anshul's self-awareness of his hopeless obsession and his inability to move past the relationship, even projecting Ganga's definitive view of his lost state.",
                "v2-28": "This line is a direct repetition from Verse 1. Anshul imagines Ganga stating, 'I don't think about you at all whether it is day or night.'",
                "v2-29": "Simultaneously, she claims, 'I rule over your head irrespective of what time it is.' This signifies her profound indifference to Anshul while acknowledging her undeniable and continuous presence in his thoughts, reinforcing the song's meta-narrative where Anshul constructs the song from her imagined perspective.",
                "v2-30": "This line translates to 'Anshul, what happened?' It is a direct repetition of the opening line of both Verse 1 and Verse 2. Appearing again here at the very end of Verse 2, just before the outro, it serves to punctuate the entire narrative.",
                "outro-1": "The Outro shifts from Ganga's imagined perspective to Anshul's direct reflections on the relationship. He describes life as a 'battlefield of war, either a win or a loss'.",
                "outro-2": "He sees everything as a strategic 'move, chess is the essence'. This metaphor emphasizes his feeling that the relationship was a game, where power and influence ('rutba') dictated who had followers ('bheerh') and who controlled everything, including 'women and fame' ('naaran te shauhrat').",
                "outro-3": "This metaphor emphasizes his feeling that the relationship was a game, where power and influence ('rutba') dictated who had followers ('bheerh') and who controlled everything, including 'women and fame' ('naaran te shauhrat').",
                "outro-4": "He sees everything as a strategic 'move, chess is the essence'. This metaphor emphasizes his feeling that the relationship was a game, where power and influence ('rutba') dictated who had followers ('bheerh') and who controlled everything, including 'women and fame' ('naaran te shauhrat').",
                "outro-5": "Anshul concludes by blaming himself, stating, 'I am at fault since I am trapped in incompetence, my destiny is wrongly accused,' repeating 'chess is the essence'. This final sentiment reveals his profound self-blame and the lingering sense of defeat, viewing the experience as a strategic loss that he attributes to his own perceived flaws.",
                "outro-6": "The Outro serves as a stark commentary on the power dynamics and personal toll of the relationship from Anshul's own, unfiltered viewpoint, concluding the track with introspection and self-condemnation.",
