        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
             const annotations = { "refrain-1": "These opening lines of the album's title track immediately establish the central theme of 'KAID,' meaning 'imprisoned' or 'trapped.' Anshul declares himself 'Trapped in these walls,' symbolizing both literal confinement and the mental or emotional barriers he faces. He also states he is 'Trapped in these gatherings/customs,' which likely refers to societal expectations, social situations, or ingrained behaviors that restrict him. This dual sense of imprisonment – by both internal and external forces – is a pervasive theme throughout the album, as he is confined by his indecision ('aakaarheen'), memories ('Ganga'), or self-destructive emotions ('aitbaar,' 'loser').", "refrain-2": "Anshul identifies himself as 'the imprisoned one (Kaidi) in solitude' and paradoxically, 'imprisoned even in open air.' This line deepens the album's central theme of 'KAID' (imprisonment) by revealing an entrapment that is profoundly internal and existential, rather than just physical or societal. He feels restricted and isolated regardless of his environment, highlighting a prison of his own psychological making. This resonates with the inner isolation seen in 'invisible man,' where he 'wanders alone in sorrow' even when surrounded by people. The paradox of 'open air' also subtly connects to his feeling of being lost and uncertain within life's boundless possibilities, a core struggle highlighted in 'aakaarheen' where he is 'stuck in the middle' of a 'lake' with 'no clear direction.' This emphasizes that his 'kaid' often stems from his own mental turmoil and indecision.", "refrain-3": "Anshul states, 'My head runs all day, trapped in these thoughts' (kaid eh vichaaran’ch), explicitly revealing his mental and emotional confinement by constant overthinking and rumination within his own mind. This pervasive inner turmoil is a central theme throughout the album's concept of 'KAID' (imprisonment). For instance, in 'aakaarheen,' he is 'kaid by his own indecision and mental turmoil,' spending 'half his day thinking about these dilemmas.' Similarly, 'loser' highlights 'bitter thoughts tormenting him at midnight,' and in 'Ganga,' memories of the titular character 'rule over his head,' inevitably resurfacing despite attempts to suppress them. Even in 'invisible man,' he acknowledges 'many of his wars are internal' and a tendency to 'overthink too much.' This line powerfully emphasizes that his 'kaid' is a deeply ingrained psychological state, a prison of his own making.", "refrain-4": "Anshul describes his 'mind/temperament as spoiled or irritated.' He then states, 'my count is in the thousands,' conveying that he is one among countless others who feel trapped or struggle in life, recognizing a shared human experience of confinement. This line expands the album's central theme of 'KAID' (imprisonment) beyond his individual plight, suggesting a universality to the internal turmoil and challenges he faces. While Anshul often grapples with profound inner isolation, such as 'wandering alone in sorrow' in 'invisible man,' this statement subtly acknowledges a broader commonality in experiencing 'kaid,' aligning with the album's exploration of universal struggles like 'shapeless dreams' in 'aakaarheen' and 'fierce daily internal struggle' in 'khoj.'", "v1-group-1": "Anshul describes being 'surrounded by friends' who are outwardly 'sweet in front of him' but whose 'words are harsh.' This establishes a theme of deceptive relationships and fragile trust, contributing to his 'KAID' (imprisonment) by false connections. It mirrors the betrayal and internal conflict explored in 'aitbaar.'", "v1-group-2": "Anshul exposes his 'friends' who 'look for opportunities to demean (him) in front of others' and 'succeed in hurting his heart.' This reveals a calculated intent to humiliate, contributing to his 'KAID' (imprisonment) by a toxic social environment and false connections.", "v1-group-3": "Anshul explicitly defines his 'KAID' as being 'imprisoned in pleasing these offspring of snakes.' This powerfully portrays his social and emotional imprisonment by toxic, deceptive relationships, a core theme throughout the album.", "v1-group-4": "Anshul observes the profound irony and insult as 'the treacherous ones now tell him what loyalty is.' This highlights the hypocrisy and emotional manipulation of his social circle, which deepens his 'KAID' (imprisonment) by toxic relationships.", "v1-group-5": "Anshul defines his deceptive social circle by stating that 'calling every third day is not friendship.' This reveals the superficial nature of these relationships, contributing to his 'KAID' (imprisonment) by a toxic social environment and emotional manipulation.", "v1-group-6": "Anshul explicitly declares, 'It's not my responsibility to pass your time.' This direct statement asserts a clear boundary, refusing to be emotionally exploited as a time-filler. This highlights the burden of others' expectations that contributes to his 'KAID.'", "v1-group-7": "Anshul critiques the hypocrisy of his supposed 'friends' who 'call their habits helplessness.' This reveals how they justify their negative behaviors as unavoidable, contributing to his 'KAID' by a social environment of self-deception.", "v1-group-8": "Anshul observes that his 'friends' speak negatively about him in front of others, 'hungry for applause.' This highlights their attention-seeking nature and their willingness to publicly criticize him for superficial validation.", "v1-group-9": "Anshul notes the hypocrisy of his 'friends' who 'text me asking for forgiveness?' after publicly speaking negatively about him. This cycle of being hurt and then subjected to insincere apologies deepens his 'KAID' (imprisonment) by deceitful relationships.", "v1-group-10": "Anshul reveals that 'this has happened before, this is not the first time,' confirming a recurrent pattern of deception and betrayal from his friends. This cyclical experience profoundly deepens his 'KAID' (imprisonment) by a toxic social environment.", "v1-group-11": "Anshul states, 'I keep a grievance in my heart but still let go of all their deeds.' This reveals a complex internal conflict: he harbors unresolved hurt and bitterness, yet chooses to outwardly release their actions, deepening his 'KAID' (imprisonment) through emotional confinement.", "hook1-group-1": "Anshul states, 'I clench my jaw, step back, and ignore their words.' The 'clenched jaw' signifies a suppressed urge to act, revealing his internal conflict as he restrains his impulses to shield himself from further harm. This is a self-preservation strategy against ongoing betrayal.", "hook1-group-2": "Anshul states, 'I put poison in my pen and melt blank papers.' This reveals he channels his internal conflict and lingering bitterness into an intense, cathartic writing process, solidifying songwriting as his primary outlet and coping mechanism for his 'KAID.'", "hook1-group-3": "Anshul states, 'Imprisoned by kinship/tribalism, I endure your taunts/mockery.' This highlights a profound 'KAID' within a toxic social environment, where social ties compel him to tolerate malicious behavior and insincere apologies, further deepening his internal conflict.", "hook1-group-4": "Anshul states, 'but in these kinds of poems, I am free.' This reveals the paradoxical freedom he finds through his art. While confined by toxic social ties and unresolved emotions, he finds absolute liberation in his writing, which serves as a sanctuary and mental escape from his imprisonment.", "v2-group-1": "Anshul states, 'I am surrounded, and my gaze does not extend beyond these four walls.' This line directly embodies the album's title 'KAID' (imprisoned in walls) and the refrain's theme of 'Kaid eh diwaaran’ch,' highlighting his profound inner isolation.", "v2-group-2": "Anshul states, 'I weigh down the bed/mattress.' This signifies that his physical presence embodies his 'KAID,' reflecting the heavy burden of his thoughts and internal struggles that prevent him from finding rest or peace.", "v2-group-3": "Anshul describes himself 'dozing naked, with his gaze fixed on the ceiling.' This reveals his profound vulnerability and mental confinement, as his fixed gaze signifies deep thought and sleeplessness, trapped by his internal struggles even in a place meant for rest.", "v2-group-4": "Anshul states, 'counting his own sins/vices.' This is an act of intense self-reflection and profound self-blame, embodying his 'KAID' (imprisonment) within his own conscience, which resonates with his self-blame in other songs like 'Ganga' and 'loser.'", "v2-group-5": "Anshul states, 'Even if I shave my entire head, it still doesn't feel completely empty, as if I have left a shikhah (a sacred tuft of hair) behind still.' This powerful metaphor illustrates his inescapable mental confinement and profound lack of peace, directly embodying his 'KAID' by his own mind.", "v2-group-6": "Anshul asks, 'What should I do differently from these 'others'?' This reveals his frustration and existential questioning, as he grapples with finding a distinct purpose amid his internal struggles and his head being 'imprisoned by thoughts.'", "v2-group-7": "Anshul states, 'where I should be clapping (applauding), there I rub my hands.' This line reveals a discrepancy where, even on occasions for celebration, Anshul gravitates towards negative emotions like anxiety, illustrating his internal conflict and inability to experience joy.", "v2-group-8": "Anshul describes himself as 'moving towards negative emotions, with this descent not in his control.' This line vividly embodies his inescapable mental confinement and profound lack of control over his internal state, highlighting the album's central theme of 'KAID.'", "v2-group-9": "Anshul states, 'Sometimes I blame you, sometimes I remember you,' directly referring to Ganga. This reveals his oscillating and unresolved emotional state, reflecting his 'KAID' (imprisonment) by her memory and his thoughts.", "v2-group-10": "Anshul states, 'He asks himself this question in his heart.' This reveals profound internal questioning and self-reflection about his emotional state and past relationships, directly embodying his 'KAID' (imprisonment) by thoughts and conscience.", "v2-group-11": "Anshul asks, 'Am I not worthy of you or are you not worthy of me?' This profound internal question directly addresses the core of his failed relationship with Ganga, revealing deep self-reflection and internal conflict regarding his own worthiness.", "v2-group-12": "Anshul asks, 'Was the time we spent together special for you too?' This line reveals his lingering doubt, pain, and insecurity about the value of their shared history, keeping him 'imprisoned by thoughts' due to a lack of closure.", "hook2-group-1": "Anshul states, 'We know ourselves to be both the victim and the problem.' This line reveals a profound paradox in his self-perception, where he simultaneously identifies as victimized by circumstances and as the source of his own difficulties. This highlights his inescapable self-blame and internal conflict.", "hook2-group-2": "Anshul states, 'lost in thoughts, perhaps searching for himself.' This line reveals his deep introspection and ongoing quest for self-understanding, directly embodying the album's central theme of 'KAID' (imprisonment) by his own mind.", "hook2-group-3": "Anshul states, 'imprisoned in thoughts, that's why I haven't left the bed yet.' This line vividly portrays his mental paralysis and profound inaction, directly embodying the album's central theme of 'KAID' (imprisonment) by his own mind and thoughts.", "hook2-group-4": "Anshul states, 'but in these kinds of poems, I am free.' This line offers a profound paradoxical release from his mental state, directly contrasting his admission of being 'imprisoned in thoughts' to the point of inaction, highlighting that writing is his ultimate escape and coping mechanism.", "v3-group-1": "Anshul states, 'I am surrounded by habits that are like friends.' This line establishes his 'KAID' (imprisonment) by his own routine and self-made patterns, where comfortable but ultimately detrimental habits trap him.", "v3-group-2": "Anshul states, 'but in front of my eyes, they conspire.' This line implies that his familiar habits are actively and insidiously working against him, even with his full awareness, leading to visible self-sabotage.", "v3-group-3": "Anshul states, 'I am blinded by its short-lived radiance.' This line reveals his 'KAID' (imprisonment) by the deceptive allure of these self-made patterns. He is drawn in by their temporary comfort, which blinds him to their true, detrimental nature.", "v3-group-4": "Anshul states, 'Habit is just a disguise, its real name is the devil.' This line profoundly characterizes his self-made patterns as destructive internal forces. It highlights Anshul's internal conflict and self-betrayal, manifesting as self-sabotage.", "v3-group-5": "Anshul states, '$50 worth of Uber Eats daily.' This line provides a concrete and striking example of his detrimental, self-indulgent habits, which vividly illustrates his self-imposed 'KAID' (imprisonment) through self-sabotage and a lack of self-control.", "v3-group-6": "Anshul states, 'Kaushal's conscience is excessively wasteful.' This profound self-diagnosis reveals his self-imposed 'KAID' (imprisonment) through a deep-seated predisposition towards self-sabotage and a lack of self-control.", "v3-group-7": "This line highlights Anshul's self-imposed 'KAID' (imprisonment) through misdirected, intense effort. He applies an academic diligence to dating apps, comparable to studying LeetCode, rather than to productive career or artistic pursuits.", "v3-group-8": "Anshul states, 'the war lost to sleep is publicly known.' This provides a direct, public acknowledgment of a fundamental failure in self-discipline, where he loses an internal battle against rest, leading to inaction. This directly illustrates his self-imposed 'KAID.'", "v3-group-9": "Anshul states, 'moreover, (he is) very stubborn, (he) doesn't accept things quickly.' This admission reveals a self-imposed 'KAID' (imprisonment) stemming from deep resistance to change and external input.", "v3-group-10": "Anshul states, 'restlessness is rooted in his soul, (he) delays every task.' This line describes a deep-seated internal turmoil that causes him to consistently procrastinate and avoid responsibilities, which illustrates his self-imposed 'KAID' (imprisonment) through persistent inaction.", "v3-group-11": "Anshul states, 'I have two faiths: my creation and my lust.' This raw, defiant declaration highlights a profound internal conflict where his artistic aspirations and primal desires both fundamentally define him.", "v3-group-12": "Anshul states, 'I am getting fatter, (and) nothing remains in my control.' This line reveals Anshul's profound self-imposed 'KAID' (imprisonment) due to physical decline and a complete lack of agency and feeling of powerlessness.", "hook3-group-1": "Anshul pleads, 'Narain, help me cross Ganga.' This direct appeal to the divine highlights Anshul's desperate desire for liberation from the profound emotional 'KAID' (imprisonment) caused by the persistent memories of Ganga.", "hook3-group-2": "Anshul states that Ganga's memories have become a troubling habit. This directly clarifies his preceding plea to Narain, revealing that these detrimental mental patterns contribute to his emotional 'KAID' (imprisonment) and his feeling of being 'imprisoned in thoughts.'", "hook3-group-3": "Anshul states, 'imprisoned in disarray, a cage is visible all around.' This 'disarray' specifically refers to his disordered habits, which form a profound self-imposed 'KAID' (imprisonment). This traps him in his own routines and a sense of lack of control.", "hook3-group-4": "Anshul states, 'but in these kinds of poems, I am free.' This line offers a powerful contrast to his preceding declaration of being 'imprisoned in disarray,' highlighting a profound, paradoxical freedom from his self-imposed 'KAID' (imprisonment) through his art."

First, the social cage, built from the "sweet" words of backstabbing friends you’re forced to entertain. Second, the mental cell, where your "gaze does not extend beyond these four walls" because you're "imprisoned in thoughts". Finally, the trap of self-sabotage, where your own habits become the "devil in disguise". But in every cell, there is one hidden key.</p>
